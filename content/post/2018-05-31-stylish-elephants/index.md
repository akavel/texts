   helper allowing to quickly create a PWA app in Elm
 - [mdgriffith/style-elements](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/mdgriffith/style-elements/4.3.0)
   — predecessor to stylish-elephants; the latter have incomplete docs as of
   today, so until they are finished, you should read style-elements guide first
   before jumping to elephants
 - [mdgriffith/stylish-elephants](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/mdgriffith/stylish-elephants/6.0.2)
 - [akavel/dodo](https://github.com/akavel/dodo) — code of the app I'm building
